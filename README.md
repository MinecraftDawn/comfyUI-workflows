## Text + ControlNet Pose + Super Resolution

This workflow integrates text-to-image generation, pose control, and high-quality super resolution. It is suitable for portfolio presentation, AI portrait creation, or research purposes.

### Features

- Natural language prompt input
- Integrates ControlNet pose images to guide output poses
- Uses the Realistic Vision model for photorealistic portraits
- Outputs images at 768x768 and upscales to 3072x3072
- Supports saving both intermediate and final images

## Output Image Explanation

- Intermediate image (e.g., 768x768): Used to preview generation quality
- Final output image (e.g., 3072x3072): Produced after super-resolution or face swap
